1) LeadTrac Management System: This project is not live yet but if needed i can demo this project. This project uses Twitter Bootstrap MVC 4, Top 10 heavily used jQuery widgets, HTML 5, CSS 3, Razor View Engine.
2) http://www.orderit.ca uses ASP.Net with C#, oData web service, jQuery, HTML5, CSS3, Twitter Bootstrap.
Challenging Phase: The challenging phase of this project was to implement responsive design to existing design using bootstrap without interrupting the functionality.
3) http://soundtelecom.bonsaimediagroup.com/ uses ASP.Net MVC, C#, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, jQuery.
4) http://www.aaavirtualoffices.com/ uses MVC 3, JavaScript, HTML 5 and CSS 3

Do you have any expertise in video conferencing web applications?
We have two scope of the project
1. Fix the current code and develop new code for mirroring factfind web application.
2. Complete development & integrate Cdeal web application to the mirroring application with all the features in it.
On our understanding the flow of the project would be like
Client will visit factfind web url
Signup for the system
Consultant will get notified that client is in.
Client can opt for conference video or automatic audio explanation support. Client will have Video conference option throughout while he is filling the form which he can opt any time.
Client will fill the factfind form while consultant will be able to see the screen what client is filling, and where consultant can instruct or pinpoint client to fill the form while client will be able to see what consultant is doing. (Mirroring feature) (Google docs has this feature)
Once client has filled the form, he will again have the option to go live with consultant on video conference with screen share and all other features in cdeal.
Hi 
Actual requirement documents are attached. But previous freelancer has developed most part of the web application, where we need to fix the bugs. Along with the bug fixing in web application we need to integrate Video Conferencing with text chat with this application.

Hi, I am Alex. 

I have more than 10 years experience in mobile app development with strong technical background in hybrid frameworks with thorough knowledge in Native app development. My strong skill stack mainly falls into NativeScript, React Native and Ionic. 

I, personally, like the feature of React Native and NativeScript to have the native-like performance and the effectiveness to build multiple platforms by writing a single code. 

I have strengthened my skills during my development life, and I have already mastered several emerging technologies. 

You could skim through my skills here to get a general idea of my technical background: 

- Native : Swift 2.2/3, Objective-C, Java 
- Hybrid Frameworks : NativeScript, Ionic / Ionic2, React Native 
- Frontend : HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Typescript, Angular / Angular2 
- Backend : Node.js, Ruby on Rails, Python 
- Database, MySQL, Sqlite, MongoDB, Postgres, RethinkDB, 
- Cloud Services : Firebase, Back& 

It's not that every framework I mentioned I am strong in are perfect, but they are definitely the promising frameworks as Javascript has become popular. 
The only challenge in using NativeScript is its young age, but the community is growing fast, and we could have plug-ins developed in the near future. 

Don't hesitate to use hybrid frameworks to build your apps. 
It should save your time and budget.
