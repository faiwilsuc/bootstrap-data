Hello

**************Angular************
First, I am willing to show and explain to you my previous Angular projects through sharing my screen so that you can confirm my skill.

Totally, I can do test,build,deploy as well as development In Angular1.x/2.0(CLI,Seed,Quickstater)/4.0.
So I am very familiar with Protractor for E2E test,Karma,Jasmine for UnitTest,Mocha etc as well as RxJS,Observables,API calling,promise,service,filter,provider,directive,pipe etc.
Of course, I am proficient in Grunt,Gulp,Bower,Babel,Webpack,Browserify,Systemjs  etc.
And I am very familiar with JWT,OAuth2,Internationalization and RBAC for log in and sign up process etc.

So I have already finished diverse POC,Admin Dashboards,SPAs,CRM ,Financial app,Educational app,Health Care apps  using MEAN stack.

******************FrontendUI******************

Also, I have good UI design skill and keen eye in UI.
So I always make  slick and graceful look and feeling, not decent look.Ok?

I think, it would be best to use AngularMaterial for UI  because AngularMaterial supports adaptive layout directive for AngularJS (Angular material 2 or PrimeNG for Angular2)
May be you use SemanticUI,OnsenUI,MDB,Bootstrap etc,too.(preferred MDB than Bootstrap)
How about your opinion?

*********************Backend*********************
In fact, I am proficient in MEAN stack(3+years of experience),so I am flexible in using mongojs, mongoose,schema for data modeling.
I have strong skill in streaming ,event operation using nodejs. I am strong in Mongodb and MySql as db.
I have enough experience in connecting frontend in to backend API, constructing RestAPI and good at Swagger,GraphQL for RestAPI,Express Middlewares,Loopback too.
