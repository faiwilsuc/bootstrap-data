Hello

Now I am willing to show and explain to you my React/Redux app through sharing my screen so that you can confirm my skill.
Really, I am very familiar with Redux/Mobx/Flux etc and I always use Redux with React app.

Do you want to Redux with Reactjs?

And I have enough experience in redux middlewares such as Redux-thunk and Redux-saga for side effect(Async API calling),Jest,Jasmine,Mocha,Chai for test,JSlint, Eslint,ES6/7,JSX,React-router,immutable.js etc. And  I am very versed in tools such Gulp,Webpack,Babel,Bower etc.

And what UI framework do you want to use in React/Redux app?

Really, I have already finished several POC,dashboard,PWA,Medical app,Educational app,HealCare Apps etc using React/Redux.

Also,I have good UI design skill and keen eye in UI
So I always make sleek and graceful looks and feeling, not decent look. Perhaps, I think,you will be surprised with my UI work.

Really, Material UI or SemanticUI are best for React App because they support React Components.
And MaterialUI is preferred than SemanticUI because it supports more components than SemanticUI.
